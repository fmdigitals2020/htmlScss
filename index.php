                    <p class="font-large">SEDCO Capital is a Shariah-compliant, ESG led asset management and investment advisory firm. We provide clients with investment solutions through a dynamic asset allocation process across diversified asset classes that deliver strong risk-adjusted returns.`</p>
                    <p>The firm is headquartered in Jeddah with offices in Riyadh, Luxembourg, London and Dubai, maintaining a global perspective and reach. <br><br> Regulated by the Capital Market Authority of Saudi Arabia (CMA), SEDCO Capital obtained its license in 2009. We began operations with four licensed activities: investment management, arranging, custody, and advisory. <br><br> In 2012 the CMA granted an additional license allowing the firm to act as principal and underwriter. We therefore extend our capabilities across four areas:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asset Management</li>
                        <li>Corporate Finance</li>
                        <li>Administration and Custody</li>
                        <li>Advisory</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Our investment philosophy is built on three pillars: Principles, Partnership, and Performance. Our strategies are designed to deliver robust performance to our clients who comprise institutions, family offices, endowments, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, ultra high net worth individuals, and other sophisticated investors. <br><br> Through SEDCO Capital, clients gain access to our expertise as well as that of more than 100 specialized managers, general partners and advisors. <br><br> Our investments span developed and emerging markets though investments in income assets that provide short to long term fixed income, in equities that are listed or private, and in real estate properties spanning a variety of market segments. We cultivate long-standing, trusted relationships with our clients and currently oversee more than USD 5.9 billion in total assets under management (AUM) built on a long record of success. SEDCO Capital is present in three locations outside Saudi Arabia:</p>
